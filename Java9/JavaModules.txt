Modularity adds a higher level of aggregation above packages.
The key new language element is the module—a uniquely named, reusable group of related packages, as well as resources (such as images and XML files) and a module descriptor specifying

1.the module’s name
2.the module’s dependencies (that is, other modules this module depends on)
3.the packages it explicitly makes available to other modules (all other packages in the module are implicitly unavailable to other modules)
4.the services it offers
5.the services it consumes
6.to what other modules it allows reflection
